## Features

- **Model Training**: Train YOLO models for detecting footballs and players.
- **Object Tracking**: Detect and track objects in football matches using ByteTrack from Supervision.
- **Video Annotation**: Annotate video frames with markers and labels.
- **Data Preparation**: Convert raw datasets to YOLOv8 format.

## Setup

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project assumes it is cloned into your `~/Documents/` folder.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/
   git clone https://github.com/runarto/datasyn-prosjekt-final.git
   cd datasyn-prosjekt-final


2. Venv
   You can choose to create a venv
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv name-of-venv
   source name-of-venv/bin/activate

3. Regardless of whether or not you created a venv, install the requirements
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run

1. If this is your **first time running the project**, open `main.py` and set the `TRAIN` flag to `True` to train the detection model:
   ```python
   TRAIN = True

2. From the root directory of the project, do:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
